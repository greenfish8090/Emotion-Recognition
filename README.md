# Emotion-Recognition
Rule based Emotion Recognition using Ant Miner.\
Ant Colony Optimization falls under the category of swarm intelligence algorithms, commonly used as a metaheuristic. It is, unsurprisingly, inspired from ants. The problem is formulated as a traversible field in which numerous ants are deployed. They follow a path dictated by the phermone levels and a problem-specific heuristic, in a probabilistic way. In this setting, the antsâ€™ paths are possible solutions and depending upon the quality, pheromones are updated in the field for the next batch of ants to consider. After sufficient iterations, the best solutions are taken.\
